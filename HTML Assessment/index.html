		I've been making a game for the past 6 months and I just released it! You can check it out if you'd like: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2256260/Ends">Link</a>. Otherwise I've been doing school and playing the occasional game. I most recently played Hollow Knight and I really liked it.
